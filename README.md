Hello everyone, I hope you're doing great. This is my first repository, and I'm excited to share it with you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This program generates and decodes code, making messages unreadable to anyone who doesn't know the secret code. There are many reasons why someone might want to make a message unreadable, such as conveying an important message securely or protecting sensitive information like an account number. This program ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message.

Working on this program has been a great learning experience for me, as I've learned many basic concepts through it. I'm very excited to continue my Python journey and to learn even more along the way.
